# OpenDMS
Cloud Device Management System (WiFi Focus)

This solution allows to manage networking devices through Cloud. It includes agent plugins in the device side, and server daemons in the cloud side. 

Typical devices are routers, access points, and MiFi 3G/4G modems. Currently, our agent works with some popular device platforms, like Openwrt, Qualcomm Atheros or embeded linuxes. We continue to add new platforms as needed.
